# Four Player Chess (Java)
<span class="post-date">Posted on 04/08/17. Updated on 11/08/17.</span>

## Rules

### Objective

Be the last king standing on the board.

### How to Play
- All the pieces move like how they normally would in a regular game of chess.
- White starts the game off, then orange, black, and finally, blue.
- When you king is in check when it is your turn,  you must get your king out of check. If your king can't get out of check, your turn will be skipped.
- Only when your king gets captured, you are eliminated from the game. (Yes, you can un-checkmate someone <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif">( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)</span> )
- En Passant can be done any player; the pawn moves to the space where the captured pawn passed.
- Promotion happens when a pawn has no squares in front of it. You may promote it to anything except a king or a pawn.

## How to Connect to the Server
1. If you are going to have friends outside your network connect to your server and you have a firewall, you will need to port forward the 2222 port. (This is the default port)
2. Load up the server and hit connect. Don't change the port number unless you know what you are doing. It will then show you your internal IP address.
3. Load up the client and type in the internal IP address. Anyone who wants to connect to the server that is inside your network must use the internal IP.
4. If your friends want to connect, they must use your external IP address which can be found&nbsp;<a title="External IP" href="https://www.whatismypublicip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.
5. Once all four players are connected and are ready, start playing!
